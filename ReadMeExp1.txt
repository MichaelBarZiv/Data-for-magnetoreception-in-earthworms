This data was created for the study name "A reproducible model for magnetoreception: earthworms in transparent soil reduce their cumulative movement in extreamly low magnetic field" by Michael Bar-Ziv, Dan Szklowin, Oren Pearlson, Yoni Vortman
All the data was dowmsampled to 1 sec intervals

Col A,"ID" =  Worm ID
Col B,"Field" = Field type
Col C, "Temperature" = Room temperature
Col D, "Weight" = Worm weight (in grams)
Col E, "Length" = Worm lenght (in mm)
Col F, "date" = date of experiment, dd-mm-yyyy
col G, "time" = time experiment started, 24h, hh-mm-ss
col H, "Density" = Jelly density type, seperated to 1-2
Col I, "PatchNum" = each time the jelly changed, by hight or density
Col J, "CumDist_Below_30_sec" = cumulative distance until 30 secs, or reaching the glass, fixed to minimum time to one of the fields
col K, "CumDist_Below_60_sec" = cumulative distance until 60 secs, or reaching the glass, fixed to minimum time to one of the fields
col L, "CumDist_Below_90_sec" = cumulative distance until 90 secs, or reaching the glass, fixed to minimum time to one of the fields
col M, "CumDist_Below_120_sec" = cumulative distance until 
120 secs, or reaching the glass, fixed to minimum time to one of the fields
col O, "CumDist_Below_180_sec" = cumulative distance until 
180 secs, or reaching the glass, fixed to minimum time to one of the fields
col P, "CumDist_Below_240_sec" = cumulative distance until 
240 secs, or reaching the glass, fixed to minimum time to one of the fields
col Q, "CumDist_Below_300_sec" = cumulative distance until 
300 secs, or reaching the glass, fixed to minimum time to one of the fields
col R, "CumTotalDist" = cumulative distance until 
reaching the glass, fixed to minimum time to one of the fields
Col S, "TimeToGlassCutoff" = time reaching the glass, fixed to minimum time to one of the fields
col T, "ReachGlass" = factorial, yes or no
col U, "Azimuth" = the Azimuth of the last location in the experiment, measured only if the worm moved more than 20 mm radius, or reached the glass 
col V, "StartDoEnd" = streight distance from the start of the experiment to the last location
col W,"StartToFurthest" = streight distance from the start of the experiment to the further location
col X, "Straightness" = StartDoEnd/CumTotalDist, measured only if the worm moved more than 20 mm radius. If not, fixed to 0.
